# redditScraper
This program will scrape your favorites from reddit. This was a quick hack I put together and could use organization.

I used this bot to scrape Reddit for keywords I could use for SEO in my blog. I would use the list of subreddits I found in my account to input them into SEMRush and generate data on what words would perform the best so that I can make content for my blog.

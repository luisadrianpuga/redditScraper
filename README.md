# redditScraper
This program will scrape your favorites from reddit. This was a quick hack I put together and could use organization.

I used this bot to scrape Reddit for keywords I could use for SEO in my blog. I would use the list of subreddits I found in my account to input them into SEMRush and generate data on what words would perform the best so that I can make content for my blog. 

This bot made it fast and easy to scrape the data from reddit and to also clean the data for duplicates. Again this is not organized as of now and is uploaded to provide my future self with a backup for future scraping Projects.
